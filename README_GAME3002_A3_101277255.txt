Collect Keys (Kunai ninja weapon) to unlock doors (with spotlights) to reach the next segment of the level. 

The kunai/key will also serve as a respawn point for death after collecting.

Your task is to reach the goal (yellow cubic region at the very top) within 2 minutes and with 5 lives remaining (At 0, the player loses)

Some jumps are hard, so to help, player is able to jump again after touching another surface (for cases of longer more difficult jumps)


Contains the following requirements:
* 2 min timer, separated at minutes, seconds and milliseconds
* Player movement inputs add Impulse to the rigidbody
* 2 traps with torque (spinning axes)
* 4 Unstable platforms with springs
* All level platforms use physics material of either: concrete, icymaterial or bouncymaterial.
* 2 SpeedUp zones and 2 Slow down zones using trigger (by default they are all concrete's physics materials, so different effects are only produced by the trigger).
* 6 spike traps
* 3 environments separated by 2 doors with hinge joints and opened only if player has enough keys/level of clearance. Detection through trigger events.
* Camera attached to the player with a spring joint, a lot of forces and damping
